## 🏗 Astro Furrets

Astro Furrets is my ([@RayhanADev](https://www.furret.codes)) preferred scaffolding for most projects! It features:

- a blazing fast and lightweight [Astro](https://astro.build) client
- lightweight and extensive [Koa.js](https://koajs.com) server
- image optimization via `astro-imagetools`
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.org) preconfigured with [furret.css](https://css.furret.codes) themes and fonts + additional PostCSS configuration
- layout with SEO metadata preconfigured, along with brand favicons, webmanifest, and sitemap data
- login and user data via custom ReplAuth authentication and store logic
- faster inline scripts with [Partytown](https://partytown.builder.io/)
- analytics scaffolding for [my Umami](https://umami.furret.codes) dashboard
- and more little additions! 🚀

I open sourced it for people to use if it suits their fancy. 🎩
